# S'up?

Not sure why you would want to visit my profile, but you are here anyway... 

I am Cloud Engineering Team-Lead at News Tech<a href="#footnote"><super>*1</super></a>, a subsidary of News Corp. My title has changed a few times over my time here, but my role (and most of my team) has stayed majorly the same.

Status:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new frontend redirection service for work... and as a personal project I am building a cyberdeck; a portable computer styled after the types of cobbled together systems made popular in cyberpunk boots and films.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing my learning on microcontrollers and electronics - a lot has changed since I was playing with them in the 90s.
- ðŸ’¬ Happy to chat about geeky stuff.

- âš¡ Fun fact: When I was in uni, I crewed for many bands and groups. These have included 'Bowling for Soup', 'Petshop Boys', 'Tiffany', 'Chesney Hawkes', 'Cheeky Girls', 'Andrew WK' and many more. I can kayak and Canoe and hold a BCU 2*.
