# S'up?

I will be parking my twitter account due to a certain space-karen changing the rules to favour extreme right-wing groups and sites under the guise of free speech.

You can find me on mastodon: https://defcon.social/@darkflib

I am Cloud Engineering Team-Lead at News Tech<a href="#footnote"><super>*1</super></a>, a subsidary of News Corp. My title has changed a few times over my time here, but my role (and most of my team) has stayed majorly the same.

Status:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new frontend redirection service for work... and as a personal project I am building a cyberdeck; a portable computer styled after the types of cobbled together systems made popular in cyberpunk books and films.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing my learning on microcontrollers and electronics - a lot has changed since I was playing with them in the 90s.
- ðŸ’¬ Happy to chat about geeky stuff.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email darkflib @ gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I was in uni, I crewed for many bands and groups. These have included 'Bowling for Soup', 'Petshop Boys', 'Tiffany', 'Chesney Hawkes', 'Cheeky Girls', 'Andrew WK' and many more. I can kayak and Canoe and hold a BCU 3*.
